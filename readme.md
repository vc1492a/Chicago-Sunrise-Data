This data set contains colors and brightness levels recorded during a sunrise in 
Chicago on October 3rd, 2016. Brightness was recorded as luminosity (lux), 
with the colors of the sky and the water recorded as RGB values. Color names are 
also included for a large portion of the data set. The data set was collected as part 
of a joint class between the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and Northwestern 
University called Data as Art.  

## Locations
There are five locations in the data set, each a spot due east of a particular red 
line stop. The locations are labelled according to the red line stop that is west 
of where the data was recorded. The sun rose at 6:50am during the data collection 
period.

## More Information
You will see some variation in the data from location to location due to the manner 
in which the data was recorded. Some sections have missing data, and others have 
repeated values.
